            Hello, and welcome to my website!
        </h1>
        <p>This is my corner of the internet. It's a space for me to learn in public and store and share ideas I find interesting. It's a home for what I'm working on and what I love. It's for me, first and foremost.</p>
        <p>I love the internet. I think there's so much power in having this much information at our fingertips. But I think the best thing about the internet is that we get to use it to learn about and make things we enjoy.</p> 
        <p>My goal here is to have fun and learn. I hope do that here too, and on your own corners of the web. I think the more we enjoy ourselves on the internet, the better it'll be.</p>
