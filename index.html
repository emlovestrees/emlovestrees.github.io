            Hello! Welcome to my website.
        </h1>
        <p>This is my corner of the internet. It's a space for me to learn in public and store and share ideas I find interesting. It's a home for what I'm working on and what I love. It's for me, first and foremost.</p>
        <p>I love the internet. I think it presents us with so much opportunity. And I believe the web is at its best as a tool to learn about and make things we enjoy.</p> 
        <p>My goal here is to have fun and learn. I think the more we enjoy ourselves on the internet, the better it'll be.</p>
